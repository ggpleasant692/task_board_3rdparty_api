## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge**: The task cards were not displaying in the correct colors.
  - **Solution**: Added logic to createTaskCard() to apply background colors based on the task's deadline using dayjs. Ensured the correct CSS classes (bg-danger for overdue, bg-warning for nearing deadline) were applied.

- **Challenge**: Modal not appearing or behaving correctly.
  - **Solution**: Corrected the HTML structure of the modal and ensured Bootstrap's JavaScript was properly included and initialized. Verified modal IDs and classes.

- **Challenge**: Tasks not maintaining their progress state after refreshing the page.
  - **Solution**: Updated the renderTaskList() function to read from localStorage and display tasks in the correct columns.

- **Challenge**: Incorrect date format causing issues.
  - **Solution**: Ensured date formats were consistent between input, storage, and display. Used jQuery UIâ€™s date picker with the correct date format and formatted dates with dayjs for display.
- **Challenge**: Getting the card to change to green when it is in the completed state.
   - **Solution**: Wasn't found.
